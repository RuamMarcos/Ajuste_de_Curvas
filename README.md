# Curve Fitting

This project implements a curve fitting method to calculate the best-fit line (least squares) given a set of input points. For comparison, two random lines are also plotted alongside.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `ajuste_de_curvas.py`: Core logic for calculating the best-fit line.
- `grafico.py`: Generates graphical visualizations of the results.
- `tabela.py`: Creates tables with the input data and computed values.
- `main.py`: Main entry point, coordinates execution of the modules.
- `teste.py`: Contains tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RuamMarcos/Ajuste_de_Curvas.git
   cd Ajuste_de_Curvas
   ```
3. (Optional) Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🧪 Running Tests
